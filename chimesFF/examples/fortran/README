Disclaimer: This code is for demonstrative purposes only and comes with no guarantees
  
This code demonstrates how chimesFF{h,cpp} can be used to obtain the
stress tensor, energy, and per-atom forces for a given system using Fortran.
See main.F90 for a usage example.

Notes: This script takes as input a standard ChIMES parameter file,
and a .xyz file with a, b, and c cell vectors  in the comment line.
This implementation does NOT use ghost atoms/layering thus the input
system MUST have box lengths greater than two times the largest outer cutoff,
or results will not be correct.

Compile with:
        make all

To test the executable:

./chimescalc-test_direct-F <parameter file> <xyz file>

e.g. ./chimescalc-test_direct-F ../../../serial_interface/tests/force_fields/published_params.liqC.2b.cubic.txt ../../../serial_interface/tests/configurations/liqC.2.5gcc_6000K.OUTCAR_#000.xyzf

Note: xyz file must be orthorhombic and must provide lattice vectors in the comment line, e.g. lx 0.0 0.0 0.0 ly 0.0 0.0 0.0 lz
