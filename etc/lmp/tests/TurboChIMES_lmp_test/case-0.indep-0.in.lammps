variable temp equal 300
variable seed equal 6306
variable iofrq equal 4

#### Initiate dynamics and set i/o  
# -- These lines are always needed, but the user can modify:
#    1. The timestep
#    2. Which fix is used, provided ${temp} is used to set the temperature
#    3. The dump modify element line
#    4. The user is free to ADD items to the thermo_style and dump custom, AT THE END of what is given here.
#    5. The number of steps to run
