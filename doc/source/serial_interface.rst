The ChIMES Calculator Serial Interface
========================================

Overview
********

The ChIMES calculator serial interface provides an easier means of evaluating ChIMES interactions for a given system. In contrast to the ChIMES calculator (i.e. ``chimesFF``), which takes information on *individual* atom clusters and returns the cluster energy, stress tensor, via ``compute_xB`` functions, the serial interface (i.e. ``serial_chimes_interface``) takes *overall* system information and returns *overall* system energy, stress tensor, and forces. Though far less flexible than direct use of ``chimesFF``, ``serial_chimes_interface`` allows users to leverage ChIMES with much less coding. For examples of how to implement the ChIMES calculator serial interface with different APIs, refer to :ref:`Implementation Examples <sec-ser-use-examples-api>`. For further details on ``chimesFF``, see :ref:`The ChIMES Calculator <page-chimesFF>`. For a complete set of ChIMES references, see :ref:`Citing ChIMES <page-citing>`. 

.. Note:: 
    The serial interface is intended to primarily serve as an easy-to-read example of how to use/implement the chimesFF library in various user codes. Hence, the implementation is not optimized for computational efficiency and therefore not recommended for use in long or large scale simulations. For users seeking a computationally efficient out-of-the-box simulation capability, we recommend using our LAMMPS implementation. See the :ref:`ChIMES in LAMMPS <page-etc>` for more details.


The ChIMES Calculator Serial Interface
****************************************

The ChIMES calculator serial interface source files are located in ``serial_interface/src/``. To use in a C++ code, simply ``#include "serial_chimes_interface.h"`` in the target code and instantiate a ``serial_chimes_interface`` object. As described in greater detail below, ``serial_chimes_interface`` objects take information on the overall system and provide the corresponding ChIMES energy, stress tensor, and forces.  Any such code must initialize the calculation the with following operations, in order:

    .. code-block:: cpp

       int my_rank = 0;
       // Instantiate
       serial_chimes_interface chimes;
       // Specify the parameter files and set  the MPI rank (replace with zero if used in serial code)
       chimes.init_chimesFF("my_parameter_file", my_rank);

.. Warning::

	It is recommended to have a supercell length of at least double the outer cutoff. For small simulation cells (e.g., a single atom in a face-centered cubic unit cell), the ChIMES calculator must be instantiated via ``serial_chimes_interface chimes(true)``. This allows for automatic replication in situations where the ChIMES outer cutoff is greater than one half of the smallest supercell length. Please note that use of extra-small simulation cells is ill-advised for aything except crystalline systems and should be used with caution. 

    *Developer note: To recover behavior of the research code, instantiate with:* ``serial_chimes_interface chimes(false)``.

Please see the following example of interfacing a C++ code with the ChIMES calculator: ``serial_interface/examples/cpp/main.cpp``. Note that the ChIMES calculator ``serial_chimes_interface`` class provides users with the following functions:

The C API
^^^^^^^^^

The C API (``chimescalc_serial_C*``) is located in ``serial_interface/api``. This wrapper provides C style name mangling and creates a  set of C-style wrapper functions. The latter are needed for compatibility with ``std::vector`` which is heavily used in ``serial_chimes_interface`` and not supported in most other languages. Any C code attempting to use the ChIMES calculator serial interface should ``#include "chimescalc_serial_C.h"``
and initialize calculations with the following operations, in order:

    .. code-block:: cpp

       int my_rank = 0;
       set_chimes_serial();         // Instantiate; as for the C++ API (see warning message), can pass 0/1 for false/true for small cells
       init_chimes_serial("my_parameter_file", my_rank); // Set MPI rank (replace with zero if used in serial code)

Please see the following example of interfacing a C code with the ChIMES calculator: ``serial_interface/examples/c/main.c``. For additional information on compiling, see :ref:`Implementation Examples <sec-ser-use-examples-api>`.

The Python API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python API (``chimescalc_serial_py.py``) is located in ``serial_interface/api``. Like the Fortran API, this wrapper enables access to
``serial_chimes_interface`` functions through the C API, via ctypes.

Any python code attempting to use the ChIMES Calculator should ``import chimescalc_serial_py`` and at least include the following
operations, in order:

    .. code-block:: python

       # Associate the wrapper with a compiled C API library file
       chimescalc_serial_py.chimes_wrapper = chimescalc_serial_py.init_chimes_wrapper("libchimescalc_dl.so")
       # Instantiate; as for the C++ API (see warning message), can pass 0/1 for false/true
       chimescalc_serial_py.set_chimes()
       # Read the parameter file, set MPI rank to 0 (i.e. no MPI used)
       chimescalc_serial_py.init_chimes("my_parameter_file", 0)


For additional information on compiling (i.e. generation of ``lib-C_wrapper-serial_interface.so``), see :ref:`Implementation Examples <sec-ser-use-examples-api>`.

Note that the ChIMES calculator serial interface ``chimescalc_serial_py`` API provides users with the following functions:

Implementation Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following codes demonstrates how ``serial_chimes_interface.{h,cpp}`` can be used to obtain the overall stress tensor, energy, and per-atom forces for a given system configuration using C, C++ Fortran, and Python. See the ``main.*`` files in each corresponding subdirectory of ``serial_interface/examples`` for further implementation details. Note that sample system configurations (i.e. ``*xyz`` files) and parameter files can be found in ``serial_interface/test/configurations`` and ``serial_interface/test/force_fields``, respectively.

.. Note:: 

    For user generated tests, note that ``*.xyz`` files must provide lattice vectors in the comment line, e.g. lx 0.0 0.0 0.0 ly 0.0 0.0 0.0 lz. Click :ref:`here <page-units>` for an overview of ChIMES units.

.. Note::

    All implementation examples are intended to be run on Unix-based systems (e.g. Linux, OSX).

.. Warning::

    These codes are for demonstrative purposes only and come with no guarantees.

.. Note::

    All example executables can be compiled at once in ``./build`` with CMake, via ``./install.sh`` from the ``chimes_calculator`` base directory, and similarly uninstalled via ``./uninstall.sh``. However, the examples below compile via the user-generated Makefiles located in each ``examples`` subdirectory, for demonstrative purposes.


* **C Example:** The ``main`` function of this example includes the C API, ``chimescalc_serial_C.{h,cpp}``, which creates a global static pointer to a ``serial_chimes_interface`` object.
  The ``serial_chimes_interface`` pointer object is set up, i.e. by ``set_chimes_serial()``, and used for access to ``serial_chimes_interface`` member functions, etc.

   * Navigate to ``serial_interface/examples/c``
   * Compile with: ``make all``
   * Test with: ``./chimescalc-test_serial-C <parameter file> <xyz file>``

* **C++ Example:** The ``main`` function of this example creates an instance of ``serial_chimes_interface`` (i.e. a class inheriting ``chimesFF``,
  which computes energy, per-atom forces, and stress tensor for an overall system). For additional details, see :ref:`The ChIMES Calculator <page-chimesFF>`

   * Navigate to ``serial_interface/examples/cpp``
   * Compile with: ``make all``
   * Test with: ``./chimescalc <parameter file> <xyz file>``

* **Fortran90 Example:** Similar to the C example, this ``main`` function establishes a pointer to a ``serial_chimes_interface`` object via ``f_set_chimes()``.
  The ``f_set_chimes()`` function call is defined in ``chimescalc_serial_F.F90,`` a wrapper for the C API ``chimescalc_serial_C.cpp`` (i.e which facilitates C-style access to
  ``serial_chimes_interface`` member functions, etc). Actual linking is achieved at compilation. See the ``Makefile`` for details.

   * Navigate to ``serial_interface/examples/fortran``
   * Compile with: ``make all``
   * Test with: ``./chimescalc-test_serial-F <parameter file> <xyz file>``

* **Fortran2008 Example:** Similarly, this ``main`` function establishes a pointer to a ``serial_chimes_interface`` object via calls to ``ChimesCalc_init()`` and subroutine calls within the ``ChimesCalc`` class, defined in ``chimescalc_serial_F08.f90.``
  Subroutines called from the Fortran2008 API act as an interface for the wrapper functions establied in the Fortran90 API. Actual linking is achieved at compilation. See the ``Makefile`` for details.

   * Navigate to ``serial_interface/examples/fortran08``
   * Compile with: ``make all``
   * Test with: ``./chimescalc-test_serial-F08 <parameter file> <xyz file>``

* **Python Example:** This example accesses ``serial_chimes_interface`` functions through ``chimescalc_serial_py.py``, a ctypes-based python API for access to the C API functions
  (i.e. through ``chimescalc_serial_C.cpp``). Once ``chimescalc_serial_py.py`` is imported, it is associated with a compiled C API library file, i.e. ``lib-C_wrapper-serial_interface.so`` and  can be used to access ``serial_chimes_interface`` member functions.

   * Navigate to ``serial_interface/examples/python``
   * Compile ``libchimescalc-serial_dl.so`` with: ``make all``
   * Rename: ``cp libchimescalc-serial_dl.so libchimescalc_dl.so``
   * Test with: ``python main.py <parameter file> <xyz file>``
